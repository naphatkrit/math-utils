# math-utils
This is a very simple Python project, meant to be used in my tutorials.

By design, the Python files in this project do not contain comments.

There are two modules: `math_utils.operations` and `math_utils.calculator`. The operations module contains some simple mathematical operations, and the calculator module contains a stateful class that maintains a current number and apply operations from the operations module to it.
